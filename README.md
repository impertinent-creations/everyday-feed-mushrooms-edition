this story is not a very original one

it is *original* in literal sense and by all means it is a *genuine* account ... of my account ... this sounds stupid ... and already makes no sense ... oh well i guess i should let the hounds lose then ... that's the rules right?

>I have been a professional meteorologist for 36 years. (...)

But, never let facts get in the way of a good storyâ€¦. there will ALWAYS be a heat wave, flood, wildfire, tornado, tyhpoon, cold wave, and snow storm somewhere. And, trust me, they will find them, and it will probably lead their newscasts.

didn't i say it is not a particularly original story? i wonder what are your thoughts right now ... i mean about the  quote ... or the author. what are this particular example of *professional meteorologist's*  views on ... eee ... breastfeeding in public spaces ... no, that isn't a good example ... eee ... spitting upwards and catching the saliva ... that one seems even less suitable ...  ... climate change?! ... or how about both common and legal practice of lobbying of public officials by profit driven corporations?

anyway, i'm sure reading this fairly uncontroversial statement by [James Spann](https://medium.com/@spann) from his article [available here](https://medium.com/@spann/the-age-of-disinformation-98d55837d7d9) you did have some ideas about the text you are reading.

i would even assume these ideas you had while doing so cushioned themselves more or less cosily within your specific *context* in both *abstract* and *not so abstract* sense of the word.

... and that's quite frankly what i want to talk about here. because unless you knew the source or *googled* the text before reading you knew nothing about the author nor his views on any subject whatsoever and all there was for you to go by was the text itself ...

or was it?

are you still around? i wouldn't be surprised to lose a reader by now; come on i promised mushrooms and so far we have only eggs and chickens.
